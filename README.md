The app works out of the box with local storage. For cloud storage, see the Firebase setup guide below.

## üìã Event Structure

Events follow this JSON structure:

```json
{
    "id": "unique-guid",
    "title": "Event Title",
    "description": "Event description...",
    "choices": [
        {
            "id": "choice-guid",
            "text": "Choice text",
            "dependentEventIds": ["event-id-1"],
            "dependentChoiceIds": ["choice-id-1"],
            "results": [
                {
                    "attribute": "education",
                    "change": 5
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "dependentEventIds": ["required-event-id"],
    "dependentChoiceIds": ["required-choice-id"],
    "trigger": {
        "education": { "min": 10, "max": 50 },
        "military": { "min": 0, "max": 100 },
        "items": ["item-id-1", "item-id-2"]
    }
}
```

## üéÆ How to Use

### Creating an Event

1. **Fill in Basic Info**:
   - Event title
   - Event description
   - Dependencies (optional)

2. **Set Trigger Conditions**:
   - Attribute ranges (Education, Military, Economy, etc.)
   - Required items

3. **Add Choices**:
   - Click "Add Choice" to create decision options
   - Each choice can have multiple results
   - Results modify game attributes

4. **Preview & Save**:
   - Click "Preview JSON" to see the generated structure
   - Click "Save Event" to store it
   - Use "Copy JSON" to copy the output

### Managing Events

- **Load Event**: Restore a previously saved event for editing
- **Export Event**: Download event as JSON file
- **Delete Event**: Remove unwanted events
- **Clear Form**: Reset the form to start fresh

## üîß Supported Attributes

The app supports these game attributes:
- Education
- Military
- Economy
- Diplomacy
- Culture
- Religion
- Happiness
- Stability

You can easily add more attributes by modifying the `addResult()` function in `script.js`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Firebase Integration (Optional)

For cloud storage and sharing events across devices:

1. Follow the [Firebase Setup Guide](firebase-setup.md)
2. Update the Firebase configuration in `script.js`
3. Uncomment the Firebase initialization code

Without Firebase, the app uses browser localStorage (events are saved locally).

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Attributes

To add new game attributes:

1. **Update the trigger section** in `index.html`:
```html
<div class="attribute-group">
    <label>New Attribute</label>
    <div class="range-inputs">
        <input type="number" id="newAttributeMin" placeholder="Min" min="0">
        <input type="number" id="newAttributeMax" placeholder="Max" min="0">
    </div>
</div>
```

2. **Update the results dropdown** in `script.js`:
```javascript
<option value="newAttribute">New Attribute</option>
```

3. **Update the trigger generation** in `script.js`:
```javascript
const attributes = ['education', 'military', 'economy', 'diplomacy', 'culture', 'religion', 'newAttribute'];
```

### Styling

Modify `styles.css` to change the appearance:
- Colors: Update the CSS custom properties
- Layout: Modify the grid layouts and spacing
- Animations: Adjust transition and animation properties

## üì± Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+

### Getting Help

1. Check the browser console for error messages

3. Try clearing the form and starting over
4. Check the Firebase setup guide if using cloud storage
